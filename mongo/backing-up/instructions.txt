Use 'backup.sh' script file. Make sure to replace the variables inside it with the ones unique to your database.

Go to /etc/crontab and add the cronjob that runs this script periodically:
20 20 	* * *	root	<path>/backup.sh > <path>/log.txt 2>&1

Note: 'path' is the path to the folder the backup script (and log file) is in.
