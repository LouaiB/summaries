Generate SSH key:
> ssh-keygen -t rsa

Location to use: ~/.ssh/
Public key is extensioned with '.pub', private isn't extensioned with anything.

Provide the public ssh key to the server you want to connect to. For a server you manage:
> cat ~/.ssh/<ssh-key>.pub | ssh louai@x.y.z.t "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized-keys"

Tip: to copy anything:
> scp ~/move.txt louai@x.y.z.t:<path>

To specify to ssh a new private key to use:
> ssh-add ~/.ssh/<ssh-private-key>

To connect:
> ssh louai@x.y.z.t

To exit:
> exit

Notes

Server has to have SSHD (SSH Daemon) installed and running to listen to incoming connections.
Every user must have their ssh public key in /home/<user>/.ssh/authorized-keys.
/etc/ssh/sshd_config to config sshd.
